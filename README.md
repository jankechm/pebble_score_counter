# Pebble Score Counter Remote Control
A Pebble smartwatch app that can count score for 2 teams. On each update, the score is sent to a Score Counter Display through connected smartphone, so it acts as a remote control.

This is the third and the last piece of the project. The functionality is limited to the most essential, for the small smartwatch screen and limited number of buttons. It allows to increment or decrement the first or the second score. It allows to choose a player mode or a referee mode. It also allows to set the orientation of the score counter display (left or right for the player mode, or same side or opposite side for the referee mode). Which score is rendered as left and which as right on the Score Counter Display is dependent on the mode and orientation set on the smartwatch app.
